# Sketchmapia
## Instructions to use the Web App
1. Click on the "Get started" text in the home page to navigate to the online tool to analyse sketch maps.
### Uploading the Maps
2. Click on the "Upload Base Map" button in the left panel and select the metric map image to load it in the app.
3. Click on the "Upload Sketch Map" button in the right panel and select all the sketch maps that are to be analysed to load it in the app.
### Annotating the Metric Map of the Experiment
5. Click on the "Edit Menu" in the top left --> Mark/Edit Base Map to open the digitizing tools for annotating metric map.
6. Use the line, polygon, edit and delete tools in the left to annotate metric map.
7. Use the route button to mark the route in the metric map.
8. Use the info button to view/hide the labels of the created features
9. Once Annotated, click on the "Edit Menu" again to save the base map.
### Annotating and Aligning the Sketch Map of the Experiment
10. Click on any of the uploaded sketch map from the list of uploaded sketch maps.
11. Click on the "Edit Menu" --> Mark/Edit Sketch Map to open the digitizing tools for annotating the sketch map.
12. Use the line, polygon, edit and delete tools in the left to annotate sketch map.
13. Click on the created feature (street or building) in the sketch map. Click on the corresponding feature in the base map. Select the Align button in the center to align the features
    in sketch map to its corresponding feature in the metric map.
14. Hovering over the aligned feature in the sketch map would highlight the corresponding feature in metric map to which it is aligned.
15. Continue the process of annotation and alignment, till all features in the sketch map that are present in metric map are aligned.
 #### For annotation :
  - If a feature has no demarcation in the sketch map, but is only respresented through labels, then the center of the label is to annotated as a point feature.
  - Street from one junction to another junction is to be annotated as a single street segment.
16. Once alignment process is completed, please save the sketch map. (This step should not be skipped in order to get the results)
17. To go to the next sketch map, click on the blue bar with dropdown symbol (available in the right side of the align button). The uploaded list of sketch maps appear. Click on any other sketch map to annotate it.
18. Repeat steps 10 to 16 and then move to the next sketch map.
19. Once all sketch maps are annotated, aligned and saved, click the "Analyse" Button. ( Checkbox next to Analyse Button - is an option to exclude qualitative accuracy)
### Results
 The Analysis process takes a longer time. Please wait till a modal appears and the completeness, generalization and qualitative accuracy values are computed and filled in. Once the values of all the sketch maps are available, the detailed results can be downloaded using the "Download" button at the end of the results.
### Save Project
The project could be save anytime using the "Download Project" available in the "File" menu at the top-left.
The downlaoded project could be uploaded later to continue the analysis process.
### Upload Project
 1. Upload Base map image.
 2. Upload all the files from the downloaded project using the "Upload Project" available in the "File" menu at the top-left.
 3. Upload all the sketch map images.
    It is important to maintain this order while uploading an existing project.
